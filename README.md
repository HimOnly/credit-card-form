Hi, this an awesome job;

But I have this little suggestion about the demo in particular.

I am thinking that you can add a final feature to the demo.gif. 

This should be that the demon should not only stop at the point of entering the card CVV.

It should include submit and return payment successful or something vey positive.

I believe it help to give the user/viewer/prospective user a more positive mindset about this project.

Thanks, keep up!

Best Regards!
